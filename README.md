# M31 Andromeda Galaxy Distance Calculator

A real-time interactive web application that displays the current distance between the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Sun, updating live as Andromeda approaches the Milky Way.

## Features

- **Real-time Distance Display**: Shows the current distance in three formats:
  - Kilometers (with decimal precision)
  - Light-years
  - Parsecs

- **Live Countdown**: Updates every 50ms to show the distance decreasing as M31 approaches at 110 km/s

- **Approach Statistics**:
  - Current approach velocity (110 km/s)
  - Time elapsed since page load
  - Distance closed since page load
  - Reference epoch (January 1, 2024)

- **Modern UI**: Dark-themed interface with gradient effects and smooth animations

## Astronomical Data

- **Base Distance**: 2.537 million light-years (2024 reference epoch)
- **Radial Velocity**: 110 km/s (approaching)
- **Reference Date**: January 1, 2024, 00:00:00 UTC

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to start the real-time distance calculator. No build process or dependencies required.

## Technology

- Pure vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5 & CSS3
- No external libraries or frameworks
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## About M31
